# Flexbox One Page Layout

This is my first flexbox project. I used flexbox before, with grid together on [Four Card Feature project](https://github.com/stankovics/FourCardFeature) . It's one page layout web site, with 6 sections. I tried to name all css classes on the way that they can be understandable.
